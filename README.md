## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I used this challenge to go back and see how quickly I could throw together a componenet card without using Bootstrap or another CSS framework. It took me just a couple hours of work to get everything functioning/looking the way I wanted.


### Useful resources

- [MDN - Box Shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped me get the box shadow all the way around the card.
- [w3schools - Image Hover Overlay](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - This is what I used to get the hover effect on the img to show the cyan background with the eyeball img.
